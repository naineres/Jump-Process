This repository contains a collection of Monte Carlo simulators and option pricing models based on advanced stochastic processes. The aim is to implement, analyze, and compare different models for option pricing, including but not limited to the Merton jump diffusion model, bilateral Gamma processes, and variance gamma models.

# Models Included
Merton Jump Diffusion Model: Utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation approach to model option prices accounting for the randomness of jumps in the asset price.

## Bilateral Gamma Option Pricing: Implements a Monte Carlo simulation of a Bilateral Gamma option pricing model, including a variance gamma extension.

## CGMY Model Simulation: Offers an exact Monte Carlo simulation for the CGMY model, which is a tempered stable process with potential applications in financial modeling.

## BNS Model Characteristic Function: Calculates the characteristic function for the BNS model and implements a Lewis integral option pricing formula.

## Stochastic Volatility Models: Incorporates Lewis integral formula pricing for several stochastic volatility models including NIGSV, VGSSV, and CGMYSV models.

## Commodity Spot Price Model: Adapts the Benth (2008) commodity spot price model to include multiple stochastic factors and a seasonality function.

## Analytical Solutions: Attempts to find analytical solutions for option prices and implied volatilities where possible, complemented by Monte Carlo simulations.
